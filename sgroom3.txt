/ReadIt
-Book1: It was during the reign of King John XVI when Christoph of Clan Grey set sail from the Westlands. He and his squirrel fleet pursued the so-called "wayward star", crossing the treacherous open waters all the way to Rodentian shores.
-Book2: The Lord of Sky Garden, Raibeart the Red, greeted the new squirrels with customary grace.||However, tensions between the two clans quickly flared...

-Mr S.: That book is sus.
-Mr S.: A squirrel fleet making the great Westlands crossing on dinky rodent ships? Not a chance.
-Mr S.: If you want my theory, I reckon us Greys came here with divine help.
