-Siobhan: Sir Verm, I want to help. And I'm not taking "no" for an answer.
-Siobhan: So I'm going to do some research at Murida's library.
-Verm: The library?
-Siobhan: Well, that's the best place|to learn new things, right?
-Siobhan: There might be a book|on the Yellow God.
-Verm: Makes sense, I guess.
-Verm: Books aren't my thing, so I'm heading to the Royal Palace.
-Verm: I bet the King knows a thing or two.
-Siobhan: Sir Verm, I don't think they let just anybody have an audience with the King...

-Siobhan: I'd love to!
-Verm: That wasn't an invitation!
-Verm: But it's not like I can stop you.
-Verm: Dizi probably knows where Sky Garden is. We'll hitch another ride.
-Siobhan: It seems a shame to leave Murida right after we got here.
-Verm: Well, I'll make sure to do a round of shopping before we go.
