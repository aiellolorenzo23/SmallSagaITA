/Nemain
-Nemain: What do you want, vagabond?
*Fight: A fight.
*Answers: Answers.
*Nothing: Nothing.

/Fight
-Verm: Want a fight?
-Nemain: As tempting as it would be to knock your whiskers off, only a fool fights over nothing.
-Nemain: Off with you already.

/Nothing
-Verm: Nothing.
-Nemain: Then stop gawking and be on your way.

/Answers
-Verm: I'm just curious...
-Verm: What's a hedge knight doing playing blademaster for a puny mole village?
-Verm: Shrews would pay you triple.
-Nemain: Not everything is about seeds.
-Nemain: Cranbaile needed help, so here I stand.
-Verm: Some help you've been.
-Nemain: I've tussled with plenty of titans in my time.
-Nemain: Victories are short-lived. The consequences are often grim.
-Nemain: Maybe you can't see beyond your own nose, but Lady Gilda is thinking of the village's future.
-Verm: And what about Siobhan's future?
-Nemain: What of it? Watch over her, or you'll answer to my mace.

/Gilda
-Gilda: Was I not clear? Get out.

/Morvyn
-Morvyn: Corrupting young Siobhan... Detestable.

-Gilda: You short-sighted fool of a daughter! What will happen if the gods see us as a threat?
-Gilda: Blades and Poison! Fire and water! They would rain hell on us, and it would be the end of Cranbaile.

-Siobhan: ...Mammy?

-Gilda: The Old Way is survival.
-Verm: The Old Way is dead.
