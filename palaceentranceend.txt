-Verm: Oh right, Sky Garden.|How's things over there?
-Bruce: Good and tidy.

-Verm: Help out?
-Gwen: Just like with Sky Garden,|there's work to do, right?
-Gwen: What, a monarchy falls and suddenly everything's hunky-dory? I wish it were that easy.
-Gwen: Mice are still hungry and homeless.|The plague's still running rampant.|The nobles still hoard their riches.
-Gwen: Progress comes bit by bit.|Little by little.

-Steve: Oh, yeah, he's dead as a doornail.
-Steve: Leo shanked him good in front of|half-a-dozen witnesses.
-Steve: No room for conspiracy theories, I'm afraid.
>SteveNext
/SteveAlex
-Verm: That fancy hat squirrel...
-Steve: Oh, Alex.
-Steve: When the news broke that the King was dead, Alex was the first to break rank and flee.
-Steve: A sailor at Canard's Wharf spotted a well-dressed squirrel jumping into the waters
-Steve: He was probably hoping to make a quick escape from the city. Maybe swim into the depths of the Underriver.
-Steve: But instead, he just straight-up sank.
-Steve: I guess the Sterling Knight floats like silver. 
>SteveNext
/SteveOphiuchus
-Verm: I never met him, but the King's Loremaster...
-Steve: Ophiuchus?
-Steve: He was last seen in the throneroom, right before everything got crazy.
-Steve: Word is he supported Leo's coup?|That surprises me.
-Steve: I had Ophiuchus down as one of 'em "don't rock the boat" brand of politicos.
-Steve: So what was his endgame?|What was his deal?|I don't really get it.
-Steve: But in any case, he found a way out the city before dawn.
-Steve: My bet is he's gone to retire somewhere in the Outlands.

/SteveLeo2
-Verm: Leo...
-Steve: He vanished. You were the last person to see him.
-Verm: Makes sense.
-Verm: Siobhan and the others didn't see him, so right after our duel he must have gone through a secret passage and left the city.
-Steve: Did you know his daughter disappeared too?
-Steve: Actually, did you even know he had a daughter? He sure liked to keep that private.
-Verm: Where are they now?
-Steve: Well, he hasn't been seen in Rodentia, so your guess is as good as mine.
-Verm: And what's your guess?
!HoldOn(0.5)
-Steve: Hmm.
!HoldOn(0.7)
-Steve: One time, I heard him tell Diego that he dreamed of settling down in Aremorio some day.
-Steve: So maybe that's where he went.|The land over the southern seas.

/SteveAquila
-Verm: Aquila...
-Steve: Uh... didn't they|fucking explode?
-Steve: That was your lot's account of events anyway.
-Steve: Siobhan said something about a "back-up timer detonation", whatever that means.
-Steve: That reminds me, have you heard the crazy god activity going on upstairs?
-Steve: Gods coming and going,|stomping and hollering...
-Steve: Do you think they're pissed off that you exploded their clocktower? 
-Verm: It's just a clocktower.|What's the big deal?
-Steve: Psh. Who knows.
>SteveNext
/SteveDiego
-Verm:  Diego...
-Steve: I didn't witness Sir Diego's duel with Leo myself, and I'm glad for that.

!HoldOn(0.5)
