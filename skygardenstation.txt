-Dizi: Oop, I'm running late.|Traffic, you know how it is.
-Dizi: The flocks are all flapping and gabbing about some loud noises over at Sky Garden.
-Dizi: You guys have an all-night rave or something?
-Verm: Something like that.
-Dizi: Nice, nice.
-Dizi: Anyways. Murida, is it?
-Siobhan: It is! How did you know?
-Dizi: Just figures. I've been taking rodents from Sky Garden to Murida all morning.
-Dizi: First a pair of mouse knights.|Then some weirdo squirrel.
-Dizi: But it don't bother me. Hop in the basket when you're ready.
