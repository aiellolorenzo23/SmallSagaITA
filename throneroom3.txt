-James: Leo, can the Thimble Guard handle them?
-Leo: The Guard is capable.
-Leo: But forcefully dispersing a peaceful crowd would only entrench their anger.
-Leo: Is violent suppression really the most dignified solution?
-James: So what do you suggest? A parley? With some tea and crumpets?
-Leo: Well, I don't know about that. But the needs of the people-
-James: Stop.

-Leo: The Thimble Guard are capable of facing any threat this city may face. 
-Aquila: Oh? Are they capable of facing the Yellow God of Death?
-Leo: Spare me this ghostly nonsense.

-James: And how much would that cost?
-Orphiuchus: Well... I would have to run the numbers.
