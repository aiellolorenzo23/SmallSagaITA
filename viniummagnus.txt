-Magnus: Verm.
-Magnus: As the Baron of Vinium, you have my most sincere apology for this terrible blunder.
-Magnus: I understand that no physical gift can ameliorate the suffering you have endured.
-Magnus: However, as compensation I would like to offer you this.

-Magnus: When Quintus was arrested, his ill-gotten property was seized under the laws of civil forfeiture.
-Magnus: I'm entrusting you both with ownership of Quintus's abode.
-Magnus: Well, one of his many abodes. I believe he used this building for surplus wine storage.

-Magnus: Does this gift suffice as|adequate compensation?
-Bruce: Aye, yeah, that's pretty nice. Cannae complain about getting a free house in this economy.

*Yep: It'll do.
*Nope: It's not enough.

/Nope
-Verm: I think it takes more than a cheap, plastic, wine cellar to fix a cock-up of this size.
-Verm: Imagine if word got out that you almost killed the Ambassador of Sky Garden...

/Farm
-Verm: I want the mushroom farm.
-Magnus: I can probably do that.
-Magnus: Like his house, the farm became property of the barony when Quintus was arrested.
-Magnus: It would be trivial to sign it over to you.
-Verm: Nah, don't sign it over to me.|Give it to Jeb and Alfie.

/Yep
-Verm: Yeah, it's fine.|No hard feelings.

/FarmDecided
-Verm: Then who gets his mushroom farm?
-Magnus: Like his house, it was confiscated when he was arrested.
-Magnus: What happens to it now is a civic matter.
-Verm: You're the Baron, aren't you?|You're the guy who makes these decisions.
-Verm: I want you to give the farm to Jeb and Alfie.
>Mushroom

/Mushroom
-Magnus: Who?
-Verm: The farm workers.
-Magnus: Oh, right. Quintus's boys.
-Magnus: I'm not convinced that two farm hands are capable of managing a corporate enterprise.
-Verm: Are you serious? They've been running the farm for seasons.
-Verm: They're far better qualified than a clean-pawed dweeb like Quintus ever was.
!HoldOn(1)
-Magnus: Well, you may have a point there.
-Magnus: But a business owned by its workers? It's an odd notion. Unprecedented, even.
-Bruce: If Verm trusts these guys, them I trust them too. Get it done, ye bureaucrat.
-Magnus: Compelling.|Fine. I'll see it done.
-Bruce: Great. I think we're all settled then.
