-Siobhan: Anyway, Mammy, I saw this guy fighting Tiger.
-Siobhan: He was swinging around a god weapon like nobody's business. 
-Siobhan: That stupid cat had no idea what he was dealing with! I think this guy might actually be able to-
-Gilda: Calm yourself, young lady.
-Siobhan: S-sorry, Mammy.
-Gilda: Mouse, you fought the felidae... with a god weapon?
*Sarcasm: What can I say?
*Sincere: I apologise.

/Sincere
-Verm: I apologise if I've broken your customs. No offence was intended.
-Morvyn: Your intentions are moot.

/Sarcasm
-Verm: What can I say? Rodent weapons are so brittle.
-Morvyn: Such arrogance!

-Morvyn: To fight a god's pet with a god's weapon...
!SetAnim(Morvyn,Look)

-Verm: Fine. I didn't plan on sticking around anyway.
-Verm: But before I go, I need some|information.
-Verm: I'm looking for the one known as the Yellow God.
-Gilda: The Yellow God?
-Gilda: I'm afraid we don't know any gods on a first-name basis around here. Except for Cormac, I suppose.
-Gilda: Have you heard of this "Yellow God", Loremaster Morvyn?
!SetAnim(Morvyn,Look)
-Morvyn: I'm afraid not, my Lady. Perhaps this mouse should head to Murida.
-Morvyn: One million mice and rats live there. Nobles, merchants, academics...
!SetAnim(Morvyn,LookBack)
-Morvyn: I'm sure one of them can be of assistance.
-Verm: That was going to be my next|destination anyway.
-Gilda: Very well. Take your leave, mouse.
