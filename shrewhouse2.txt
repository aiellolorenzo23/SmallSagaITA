-Verm: I don't suppose you sell any armour here?
-Penelope: All fashion is armour. We wear clothes to survive the harshness of our everyday lives.
-Verm: But what about surviving, like, stab wounds?
-Penelope: That is outside my speciality.

/AbbozzatoEnd
-Penelope: The cloak should fit anyone. But who can pull it off? That is a tougher question.

-Verm: Hey, are you Penelope, the clothes lady?
!HoldOn(0.6)
-Penelope: "Clothes lady"?
!HoldOn(0.3)
-Verm: Sorry, what's the right word?|Seamsmith? Clothmonger?
!HoldOn(0.4)
-Penelope: Those are not words.
-Penelope: I am a creator of bespoke, high-end, haute couture fashion.
!HoldOn(0.8)
-Verm: Okay, look. This is outside my area. I'm just going by what Abbozzato said.
-Penelope: Ahh, Abbozzato found a new apprentice. Now the full garment comes together.
-Penelope: Run and tell that unprofessional slug-brain that he must make his orders in person.
-Verm: He told me you owed him a favour.
!HoldOn(0.9)
-Penelope: Well... there is some truth to that.
-Penelope: For all his brashness, the foolish merchant does reach out to those in need.
-Penelope: What did he want?
!ShowItem(Prota,52)
!HoldOn(1)
-Penelope: This fabric... it is exquisite. There's no denying that.
-Penelope: What does he want doing with it?
-Verm: He said to turn it into clothes.
-Penelope: What kind of clothes?|What style?
-Verm: He didn't say.
-Penelope: Well that's no good.
-Penelope: As his apprentice, you can be his mouthpiece. Give me some direction.
-Verm: I don't think that's a good idea.
-Penelope: Trust me, it's fine. I can make even the ugliest idea into a beautiful reality.
-Penelope: Now. What feeling are we trying to convey with this garment?

-Penelope: This is not a simple overcloak one would wear to run errands at the market.
-Penelope: This is a statement piece. An unapologetic artistic display.
-Penelope: This is what one would wear to dazzle with the power of a titan and the majesty of a queen.

-Bruce: I'm looking for a mouse. Have any shopped here recently?
-Penelope: One or two. What were they wearing?
-Bruce: Rags and bandages, most likely.
!HoldOn(1)
-Penelope: Darling, this is a bespoke, high-end, haute couture fashion boutique.
-Penelope: If my customers walked out the door wearing rags, then I will have failed in my duties.
-Bruce: Ah, fair point.
-Penelope: Nice kilt, by the way.
-Bruce: Thanks! It has a sporran.
