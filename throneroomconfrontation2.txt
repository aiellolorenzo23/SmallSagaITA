-Steve: Uh... it's not great.
-Steve: Word is things quickly got violent.|The city's barricades were overrun.

-Leo: We must leave the palace immediately.

-Ophiuchus: One tunnel leads to the Wharf, which will give us access to the Underriver.

-Leo: Your Majesty, unleashing Excalibur may deter the Yellow God.
-Leo: But if my understanding of the weapon is correct, it would kill countless rodents, members of your own Kingdom whom you are sworn to serve.
-James: They're riotous louts who wish to put my head on a pike.
-James: Their lives are forfeit.
!HoldOn(0.5)
-James: Loremaster, stop dithering and write the memo.
-Ophiuchus: Um. Your Majesty. This decision... it is not to be made lightly. Please deliberate-
-James: By the gods,|you are both pathetic!
-James: I'll issue the order myself.

-James: Every right, every privilege...|No, our whole Rodentian way of life is maintained at the end of a sword.
-James: So don't stand there in the garb of a knight and act like you're better than our violent institution.
