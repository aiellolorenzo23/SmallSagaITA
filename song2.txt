005 Pilgrim, the world stretches yonder

014 Full of romance and wonder
018
019 Full of heartbreak and splendour.

027 Go, and may no foes surround you
034 
035 Feral titans not hound you
039 
040 May no peril confound you.
047 
048 And though your pawprints lead far away from here
057 
059 As lost in the wild realms you roam
067 
069 Still may you hear the call of the fireside
078 
080 Still may your journey bring you home.
