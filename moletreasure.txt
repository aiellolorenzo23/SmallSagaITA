-Siobhan: Even better. A god weapon, like yours.
-Siobhan: I've got it working. Even spruced it up to pack a proper punch.
-Siobhan: But it's in need of a field test.
-Siobhan: I... thought I could use it. On Tiger. Give him what-for.
-Siobhan: Maybe save the village.

-Siobhan: I was hoping you would do it, you know, because you're a chivalrous knight.
-Verm: Like I said, I'm not a knight. I didn't come here to do charity work.
-Verm: So go rally the Thimble Guard or something. I'm out.
