/Q1
-Dee: I'm the mouse who|wrote an RPG.

/Q2
-Dee: Oh sheesh, it's about, uh...
-Dee: Overcoming nature?|Order and rebellion?|Little guys with swords?
-Dee: That's a question best left for the players, I think.
>Qs

/Q3
-Dee: It was quite a journey. Took me over 6 years. Which is a VERY long time for a mouse.
-Dee: But I'm not complaining. I knew what I was in for when I started writing.
-Dee: People say that you leave a little bit of yourself in the things you create.
-Dee: I think there's truth to that.|I'm not the same person I was when I started.
-Dee: Heck, Rodentia's changed a lot too. A pandemic, a recession, new leader after new leader...
-Dee: Oh, I'm rambling.
>Qs

/Q4
-Dee: What's next?|WHAT'S NEXT?!
-Dee: I'm taking a damn break.
-Dee: Then it's bug fixes,|localisation and what-not.
-Dee: But then... maybe I'll write a strategy game about axolotls.
-Dee: Or a rhythm game about cicadas.
-Dee: Or a MOBA about jellyfish! Who knows.
-Verm: What's a MOBA?
-Dee: Never mind that.
>Qs

/Q5
-Dee: Advice? What, you think I've got some wisdom to dispense? Uhhh...
-Dee: Developers who say "I'm gonna|make an RPG" are arrogant fools.|Do not trust them.
-Dee: That's all I've got.|Good luck out there.
