-Siobhan: Blood and bleach... Just what kind of place is White Hall?
-Gwen: It's difficult to describe.
-Gwen: In some ways, it's a paradise.
-Gwen: The White God who runs the Hall provides for the residents.
-Gwen: He gives us endless food and clean housing.
-Siobhan: Oh, I get it! Like a pet dwelling.
-Gwen: No, that's not quite right.
-Gwen: Gods give freely to those called "pets", right? But this relationship felt more transactional.

-Gwen: If we didn't, well, Sir George would get mad.
-Siobhan: Sir George is... the town's vassal? The leader?
-Gwen: Ha! He likes to think so.
