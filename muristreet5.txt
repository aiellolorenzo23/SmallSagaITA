-Farqad: I'm seeking adventurers for an expedition. A voyage of glory and wonder!
-Farqad: What say you?
*FarqadMore: I'm intrigued.
*FarqadNo: I'm out.

/FarqadNo
-Verm: No thanks.
-Farqad: Ah. Well, if you change your mind...

/FarqadMore
-Verm: I'd be lying if I said I wasn't curious.
-Bruce: Aye, it's hard to deny the allure of swashbuckling, isn't it?
-Gwen: Sounds good to me. We could capture a royal naval vessel and hold it for ransom.
-Siobhan: I'll ready the cannons!
-Farqad: Woah, woah! You've all got the wrong idea!
-Farqad: I'm not a pirate! I'm just an explorer!
-Verm:  Oh. 
-Siobhan: Um. I have a question.
-Siobhan: The land around Rodentia is all thoroughly explored, no?
-Siobhan: So 
-Farqad: So one 
-Farqad: There's an island at the mouth of the King's River.
-Farqad: It comes and goes. Drifts with the tides and winds.
-Farqad: Its surface dances in the setting sun, earning it the name of "The Glistening Isle".
-Gwen: A moving, dancing island...
-Siobhan: Oh, I know this one!|It's an old fairy tale.
-Siobhan: It turns out the island is just the back of a whale, right?
-Bruce: It was the back of a turtle in the version I heard.
-Farqad: The Glistening Isle is no mariner's fable.
-Farqad: I caught a glimpse of it with my own eyes as I was making the voyage to Murida.
-Verm: What's the pay?
-Farqad: Ten seeds upfront.
-Verm: That's pittance for such a risky venture.
-Farqad: Ah, wait, wait.
-Farqad: I'll also let you keep all the spoils you can carry. No strings attached.
-Bruce: Well that sounds like a fair deal, right Verm?
-Verm: Only an idiot takes work on the promise of future royalties.
-Verm: But still...
-Bruce: Ooh, yeah. Verm's in.
-Farqad: Come back and speak to me when you're ready.
