-Connor: I wanna join the Thimble Guard some day.
-Connor: I could be a real hero!|Like Mathwell or Diego or Leo.
-Connor: But I can't afford the fees.|So I'll stick with the family business.
*Fee: Fees?
*Business: Business?

/ConnorSio
-Connor: How's the hat holding up?
-Siobhan: It's wonderful. Thank you, Connor.

/Fee
-Verm: Wait, you have to pay a fee to join the Guard?
-Connor: Sort of. You have to pay to get the proper certifications and equipment and stuff.
-Connor: It's not much for nobles.|But it's quite a bit for us Gutter folk.
-Verm: I see.
>WantSomething

/Business
-Verm: Family business?
-Connor: Weaving, of course.|Quilting, sewing, knitting, embroidery, I can do it all.
-Connor: Needlework runs in field mouse blood. So they say at least.
-Verm: I see.

-Connor: I could offer him some of my best silk instead. Do you think that'll cover the cost?
*Probably: No idea.
*ProbablyNot: I doubt it.

/Probably
-Verm: How should I know? Linen, rags, silk, it's all just cloth to me.
>Whatever

-Connor: Oh. Well... it's all I got.
>Whatever

/Whatever
