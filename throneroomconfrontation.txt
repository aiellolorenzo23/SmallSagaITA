-Alex:  Leo. 
-Leo: You reek of alcohol, Sir Alex. Did you abandon your post just to go wallow in a tavern gutter?
-Alex: There's good intel to be gained from tavern gutters, Needle Knight. 
-Alex: Heh. Why, the things you overhear...
-Leo: Out with it.

-Alex: There's an unsavoury gathering happening tonight in the slums.
-Alex: Hundreds of rodents, all threatening to march on the palace.
-James: A protest? Without a licence?!
-Leo: Who are the organisers?
-Alex: I don't know their names.
-Alex: But some devil-tailed vagabond mouse with a god-sword was chief among them. He looked familiar.

-James: For the peasants to revolt on tonight of all nights...
-Ophiuchus: It is no coincidence.
-Ophiuchus: They must have caught wind of the imminent danger above us.
-James: So it's an opportunistic rebellion then.
-James: They wish to leverage the chaos to overthrow me, just like they did with the squirrel duke.
-Ophiuchus: Well, I don't know about that... but, yes, this is a security concern.
