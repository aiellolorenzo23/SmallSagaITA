-Tim: I see. So you need to freshen up your music skills.
-Tim: And Anton thought I could give you some pointers.
-Bruce: Aye, that's right.
-Tim: Let's skip the music theory and go straight into practice.
-Tim: No better way to learn to swim than by leaping in the deep end, right?
-Bruce: Unless ye drown.
-Tim: Ah. Well. Nonetheless.
-Tim: How about we play Gilded Roy's Melody? You know that one?
-Bruce: Yeah, of course. It's a classic.
-Tim: Rad. I'll grade your performance. Just like a school exam, ha ha!
-Bruce: No pressure, then.
-Tim: Nah, it's not so serious. You can always try again.
-Tim: Are you ready to play now?
*LetsPlay: Let's play.

-Tim: Hmm. Well, it was an A+ for effort, but you dropped quite a few notes.

/Good
-Tim: Ooooh, very nice! A-! Solid performance.
-Bruce: It was good?

-Bruce: I dunno. I just feel like there's more work to do.
-Tim: Hmmmm.
-Tim: How about you go rock out with Violet the Screeching Creature?
-Bruce: The punky bat with the guitar?
-Bruce: I dinnae think our styles of music are a match.
-Tim: Ha ha, yeah. She's got an edge, no doubt about that.
-Tim: Y'know, after Josh was ousted, she refused to talk to me. Or any of the Grey squirrels, actually.
-Tim: And I don't blame her! Josh's regime was messed up.

-Tim: It's not like a few notes magically undid all the wrongs or anything.
-Tim: But like... there's a common language in music. It transcends genre and style.
-Tim: It speaks straight to the heart.|Is that too cliché?
-Bruce: No, I get it.|A common language.
-Bruce: Thanks, Tim. I'll go speak to Violet then.
