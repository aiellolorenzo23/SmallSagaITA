-Bree: We have to work our fingers bloody to make rent.
-Bree: Meanwhile, the high an' mighty nobles get rich off our sweat!
-Bree: Tell me, how is that fair?
-Stilton: You tell 'em, Bree!
-Bree: And what little we have left is taxed to the heavens.
-Bree: But where do our taxes go?
-Bree: Is the King even doing anything about the Yellow God crisis?
-Bree: Or is he busy buying shiny new uniforms for the Thimble Guard?
-Stilton: Hear, hear!

/Bree
-Siobhan: Did you say Yellow God?
-Bree: Yeah! We've done our research.
-Bree: The Yellow God of Death is coming to Murida.
-Bree: An' he's gonna lay waste to the city if we don't do something.
-Siobhan: You might be right...

/Rando
-Rando: This Yellow God business seems far-fetched...
-Rando: But Bree's right about the rent problem. It's appalling.

/Rando2
-Rando2: If I had a seed for every weirdo who preached about end-times...

/Rando3
-Rando3: Bree has right to protest, so the Guard are tolerating him.
-Rando3: But he's pushing his luck. They'll arrest him sooner or later.

/Stilton
-Stilton: Bree and me had a couple of run-ins with this li'l angry guy.
-Stilton: He had a bit of a Yellow God obsession. We thought he was nuts.
-Stilton: But after doing some research, turns out the Yellow God's a real threat.

/Rando4
-Rando4: I have a cousin whose home was destroyed by the Yellow God.

/Rando5
-Rando5: The Yellow God's not real.
-Rando5: Bree's obviously making stuff up so he can sell divine protection charms.

/Benny
-Benny: People afraid of the Yellow God should just sell their homes and move.
