-Stilton: We've been doing our homework! We know the damage coming our way!
-Bree: Yeah! So we're planning a protest.
-Stilton: We got hundreds of|allies in Gutter End!
-Bree: Hundreds! And we're gonna march on the palace gates, and have a word with His Majesty himself!
-Stilton: We've got a list of demands.|A proper manifesto!

-Siobhan: We can't just waltz in.|We'd be arrested for sure.
-Siobhan: But if there's a protest, that would distract the guards.
-Siobhan: It might give us a window|of opportunity to reach the weapon|and destroy it.
-Bruce: Aye, but how do we reach|the Yellow God from there?
!HoldOn(0.4)

-Gwen: Okay. So.
-Gwen: Assuming we gain access|to the palace.
-Gwen: And assuming we destroy Excalibur.
-Gwen: And assuming we find a secret tunnel.
-Gwen: Then it's just the simple matter of killing a God of Death.
-Gwen: Easy-peasy. Right, Verm?
!HoldOn(1)
-Verm: Diversions and secret passages, kings and gods...
