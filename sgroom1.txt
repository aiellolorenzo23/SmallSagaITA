!CheckGlobal(18,40,ChestLate)
-Violet: Something tells me that you're scheming against the Duke.
-Violet: So go ahead and keep that.|Maybe it'll come in handy.

/ChestLate
-Violet: It's all yours!|Call it a "thank you" for kicking the Duke's ass.

-Violet: I heard you and Mr Tuba tooting away upstairs.
-Bruce: Aye, yeah, Tim. He was helping me practise.
-Violet: I see.
-Bruce: I know he worked for the Duke an' all, but I think he's a good guy.
-Violet: Mm.
-Bruce: He said music transcends language. I think he's got a point there!
-Violet: Mm.
!HoldOn(0.7)
-Bruce: Something up?
!HoldOn(0.9)
-Violet: Tim and the others are trying. I can see that.
-Violet: But it's like, they want to play music and dance and pretend that everything's hunky dory?
-Violet: It's never that simple.|Clan Grey's got work to do.
!SetAnim(Violet,Loop)
-Violet: Still, he's right that there's something primal about music.
!SetAnim(Violet,Pause)
-Violet: Raw emotion in sound form!|That's powerful stuff.
-Violet: So on that note [heh],|you wanna jam?
-Bruce: Aye, that'd be great. I need to shake this rust off.
-Violet: No shame in a bit of rust.
-Violet: Sometimes you just gotta step away from your instrument for a bit. Clear your head.
!SetAnim(Violet,Loop)
-Violet: But sometimes you gotta face the music and smash through whatever barrier's holding you back.
!SetAnim(Violet,Pause)
-Bruce: Makes sense tae me.
-Violet: Cool. So, you're ready?
*LetsPlay: Let's play.
*NotNow: Not now.

/NotNow
-Bruce: Not right now.
-Violet: Suit yourself. I'll be waiting.

-Bruce: Hah, yeah, I did! Shall we play one more?
>PostPerformance

/Perfect
-Violet: That was metal as hell!|You didn't make a single mistake.

-Violet: Nah, no need. You sound like an absolute pro.
-Violet: Actually, you know what? You should go back upstairs and show Anton what you learned.
-Bruce: A performance for Anton... why does that sound so scary?
-Violet: Ha, don't sweat it. He'll be impressed with your improvement. I got no doubt.
