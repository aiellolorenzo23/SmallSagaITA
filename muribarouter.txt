-Alex: I've got a job. There's a thousand seeds in it. Interested?
-Verm: You're drinking something that smells like vinegar.
-Verm: I don't think you have a thousand seeds to give.
-Alex: Tsk. Shows what you know about wealth. Or fine alcohol for that matter.
-Alex: They call me "the Sterling Knight" for a reason, y'know.
-Verm: Fine, I get it, you're loaded.|Who's the target?

-Alex: I'll spare you the details, but we were out on a reconnaissance mission.
-Alex: Then the younger one spotted something and got spooked.
-Alex: She went crazy, and took a swing at me, unprovoked.
-Alex: I fought back. Blood was drawn.
-Alex: Then the older one stepped in and took a swipe at me too.
-Alex: I was lucky to make it out alive.
-Verm: So you want me to track down these two deserter knights.
-Verm: And then what?
!HoldOn(0.3)
-Alex: Bring them to justice.
-Verm: You mean, kill them?
-Alex: Attacking a superior officer is a capital offence.
-Alex: Sheesh, I didn't think four hardened warriors would be such prissy pansies.
-Bruce: This guy's the worst.
-Gwen: Even by tin-head standards.
-Gwen: He's trying to rope us into a murder scheme just to keep his own paws clean. Disgusting.
-Siobhan: I think we should take the job.
