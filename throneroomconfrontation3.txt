-Verm: Blademaster Leo...
-Verm: I'm here to talk with the King.
-Leo: You missed your chance for that, I'm afraid.
-Leo: Not that His Majesty was open to conversation.

-Verm: But I don't particularly care.
-Verm: There's a route to the surface from this room, right?
-Verm: The Yellow God of Death is coming. Let me use the passage,|and I'll stop Him.
-Leo: A mouse like you cannot kill a god. You lack the weight.
-Verm: But it's worth a shot, right?
-Verm: I might actually|be able to do it.
!HoldOn(0.8)
-Leo: Honestly?
!HoldOn(0.5)
-Leo: Yes, you might.
-Leo: And that possibility|terrifies me.
-Leo: What will happen when you|do the impossible and|slay an immortal god?
-Leo: Will the citizens deify you?|Will they crown you "Verm, the mouse who stands above gods"?
-Leo: I dread to think what you would do with such power.
*GodYes: You're right.
*GodNo: You're wrong.

/GodNo
-Verm: Hold on. I don't have any intention of ruling anyone.
!HoldOn(0.9)
-Leo: So you would leave this country godless and kingless?
-Verm: Would that be wrong?
!HoldOn(1.2)
-Leo: What is a Kingdom without a King?
-Leo: I honestly don't know.|I can't even conceive|of such a place.
!HoldOn(0.4)
-Leo: This palace of blood and bone is grotesque.
-Leo: But beyond it lies the unknown.
-Leo: And that is where the|true horrors lie.

/GodYes
-Verm: You have a point.|I wouldn't mind having some power.
!HoldOn(0.4)
-Verm: But honestly, I have no idea what I'd do with it. I haven't thought that far ahead.
-Leo: Tsk. Of course.|I suspected as much.
-Leo: A mouse like you only focuses on the moment.
-Leo: So let me speculate what will happen if you were crowned.
-Leo: You will continue your|petty vengeance quest.
-Leo: You will declare war|against all gods.
-Leo: When the gods retaliate - and they will retaliate - it won't just be Murida that falls.
-Leo: It will be the total|eradication of Rodentia.

-Leo: You are the kind of mouse who would see the Kingdom in ruins to serve your quest.

-Leo: Vagabond...
-Leo: You had a dozen opportunities|to slay me in that duel.
-Leo: But you held back.
-Leo: Why? Was your intent|to humiliate me?
-Leo: Or is this your twisted|notion of chivalry?
!HoldOn(1)
-Verm: Maybe I should|finish you off.|It's what you deserve.
!HoldOn(0.5)
-Verm: This Kingdom is rotten.
-Verm: The royals and barons and dukes and nobles are all scum.
-Verm: The Knights are all scum. You included.
-Verm: The Yellow God is knocking, and you're all busy protecting your empty palace.
-Verm: But... the rot runs deeper than you, or the King, or any titan or God.
-Verm: I know that killing you won't remove the rot.
-Verm: So I thought I'd break|your tools instead.
-Verm: What's a Blademaster|without a blade?
-Verm: Just another mouse.
