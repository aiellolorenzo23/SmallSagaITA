009 It's of a mouse named Leo
012 And his chivalrous acts so brave
015 A titan-slayer bold and valiant
018 Equal to any foe who'd challenge
020 His god-forged needle blade.
024 
034 The Thimble Guard at Solhill
037 In a desperate fight were locked
040 The shrew's defences overrun
042 And the captain's strategies all undone
045 By Ironfang the fox.
049 
060 Death stalked the town
063 Solhill braced for the end
065 As the fox closed for the kill
068 And Leo took the field
071 He'd not back down
073 For a Thimble Knight's
075 Sworn every life to defend.
080 Here's health to brave Sir Leo
083 And his miracle blade so bright
086 Where evil prowled and danger beckoned
088 He sent that monster back to heav'n
091 With a needle through the eye.
