-Aiden: But who shines the brightest?|The strong, the smart, the privileged.
-Aiden: Those are the rodents|who wield power.
-Aiden: They get to write rules. They make important decisions, like choosing who's "in" or "out".
-Aiden: But if there's no formally recognised leader, then the lack of leadership becomes a mask.
-Aiden: The ones who shine brightest still get to write the rules, but the writing goes unseen.

/Right
-Verm: Maybe you're right. About structure and stuff, I mean.
-Verm: If there's no structure at all, then yeah, that just leads to some people taking advantage.
-Verm: As a kid, I saw that myself in the lawless tunnels of the Underriver.
-Verm: But when I see someone sitting smugly on a throne while others suffer, I feel angry. That's not fair at all.
-Verm: So maybe the problem isn't structure itself. It's...
*Institution: The institutions.
*Inequality: The inequality.

/Wrong
-Verm: You're completely wrong. You've been spouting mindless filth for the last five minutes.
-Aiden: Charming.
-Verm: "Angry mobs are bad, so I have to support tyrants"? That's absolute worms-for-brains logic.
-Aiden: That's not quite-
-Verm: It's what you meant.|I'm not stupid.
-Verm: You've misunderstood|the whole problem.
-Verm: It was never about structure versus no structure. The problem is...
*Institution: The institutions.
*Inequality: The inequality.

/Institution
-Verm: The problem is the institutions that bring tyrants to power and continue to uphold them.
-Verm: No institution is above accountability. If they cannot serve society ethically, they should be reformed or dismantled.
!HoldOn(0.8)
-Aiden: Wow.
-Aiden: Honestly, I thought you a brute.
-Aiden: I didn't know you had|that kind of vocabulary.
-Verm: Yeah, I dunno where that came from. Maybe I channelled Siobhan for a moment.
-Aiden: Your world view is overly simplistic, though.
-Aiden: Who dismantles the institutions?|Who replaces them?
-Aiden: You still need the hierarchy. That's an intrinsic part of all societies.
-Verm: Well, what about mushroom societies?
>Mushroom

/Inequality
-Verm: The problem is that inequality creates a power difference.
-Verm: You said yourself that the "privileged" are the ones who "shine bright".
-Verm: Well, why can't the unprivileged be helped to shine brighter?
-Verm: If the playing field is level, then the power is spread.
-Verm: Then it would be harder for any bad guy to take advantage.

-Aiden: Okay. I thought we were getting somewhere, but you've lost me.
-Aiden: What, exactly, is a "mushroom society"?
-Verm: Ah, sorry. I've been farming mushrooms for the last few months, so it's hard to get them out of my head.
-Verm: Some mushrooms have roots. Well, Jeb called them something else, but they're basically roots.
-Verm: I've noticed that some of these mushrooms have organised roots, where they spread and split, like an upside-down tree.
-Verm: But some mushrooms have roots that are more like a tangled web. You can't tell where one starts and another ends.
-Verm: These roots sprout new mushrooms, so you can't even tell what the original mushroom is.
-Verm: There's no mushroom leader. But they thrive all the same.
