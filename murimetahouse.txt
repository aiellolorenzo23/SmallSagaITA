/Nothing
-Verm: I'll leave you be.

/Berserk
-Meta-Mouse: For most characters, Berserk boosts attack damage by 50%.
-Meta-Mouse: But for Berserkers, it works a bit differently: they hit twice with every strike, effectively dealing 100% more damage!
-Meta-Mouse: So don't settle for good-natured swings. Get mad. Get real angry, baby!
>WannaKnow

/Stacking
-Meta-Mouse: Most status effects don't get more effective the more they "stack".
-Meta-Mouse: So a creature with 3 Berserk will do as much bonus damage as a creature with 1 Berserk.
-Meta-Mouse: There are two exceptions to this.
-Meta-Mouse: One. Bleeding. The higher the bleeding number, the more damage you'll take each turn.
-Meta-Mouse: Two. Charge. Load up a fire wand with three or four charges, and baby, you've got massive damage potential on ya paws!
>WannaKnow

/Damage
-Meta-Mouse: Some attacks hit harder than others.
-Meta-Mouse: But it can be tricky to calculate just how much harder because ya gotta factor in enemy defence.
-Meta-Mouse: For a high-defence enemy, is it better to go with lots of small attacks or one big attack?
-Meta-Mouse: That's for you to work out!
>WannaKnow

/Breaks
-Meta-Mouse: "Defence Break" makes the recipient take 50% more damage.
-Meta-Mouse: "Attack Break" makes the recipient deal 33% less damage.
-Meta-Mouse: Simple as.
>WannaKnow

/Missable
-Meta-Mouse: Ooooh, heh heh. Yeah. There are missable items.
-Meta-Mouse: There's even one right behind that door.
!CheckItem(36,Missable2)
-Meta-Mouse: But my advice? Don't sweat it. Just do your thing.
-Meta-Mouse: A mouse could go crazy trying to play a game perfectly, ya know!
>WannaKnow

/Missable2
-Meta-Mouse: Or at least... there WAS!
-Meta-Mouse: Look at you, you little completionist! You don't leave any pebble left unturned, do ya?
