-Josh: ...Is domination.
-Josh: That's the best feeling.|the ultimate pleasure.
-John: When you're in control,|everything runs smoothly.
-Josh: Comfort, freedom, security.|Sky Garden's got it all.
-Josh: And the best part is,|the people want to be dominated.
-Josh: Sure, they whine. They complain.|They make up words for you like "coloniser" and "fascist".
-Josh: But deep down? The people don't want to think about their problems. They want to be controlled.
-Josh: So I'm just doing everyone a favour.|That's my burden as the dominator.

-Verm: I'm looking for the Yellow God of Death.
-Verm: And I heard some "Cailleach" of an "Ashen Tower" could help me find Him.
-Verm: I want directions.
-Josh: Death Gods and Cailleaches. Ring any bells, Loremaster?
-Evan: Lol, yes, of course.|As a matter of fact-
-Josh: Nope, no bells rung.|Our memories sure are foggy.
-Josh: But maybe the fog could be cleared with a small tribute to the throne, if ya catch my drift.
-Verm: A bribe?
