-Verm: It's just paint, right? Is there a craft supplies shop in Murida or something?
-Beth: If only!
-Beth: We have to make our own pigments from natural materials.
-Beth: To craft a perfect indigo, we first must pluck forty petals from a hydrangea in full bloom...
-Verm: I don't have time for that.
-Verm: How about I just go nab some godly paint instead? That would be easy.
