!HoldOn(0.6)
-Verm: Hold on. This doesn't add up.
-Verm: I heard you kicked all the soldiers out of Sky Garden.
-Gwen: We gave them each a choice. Reform or exile.
-Gwen: Aiden refused both options.
-Bruce: Aye, so that put us in a bit of a quandary.
-Bruce: Gwen suggested attaching him to a magic missile and firing him at the sun, like ol' Murray Cloudrunner.
-Bruce: But I said naw, if he wants to stay in Sky Garden so badly, then let him.
-Bruce: So now he's the sole dungeon resident.
-Bruce: It's nae bother. We feed him properly an' all.
!HoldOn(0.6)
-Gwen: I hate it.
-Gwen: Dungeons are grotesque. We shouldn't use them, even for the scummiest of cachgwn.
-Bruce: Imprisoning Aiden is bad, but launching him into the sun is okay?!
-Gwen: I contain multitudes.

-Felix: Beats me. It wouldn't be a good use of your time.
-Felix: There's no, like, secret items or anything down there.
-Felix: But hey, the option's there.
