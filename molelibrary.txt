-Innogen: Can I help you with something?

*YGod: The Yellow God...
*Lib: The library...
*Nevermind: Never mind.

/InnoLate
-Innogen: Butterflies carry|all sorts of news.
-Innogen: Some say that a mouse and mole were instrumental to the coup at Sky Garden.
-Verm: Nothing to do with me.
-Innogen: Mm-hmm.


/YGod
-Verm: Would you happen to have any books on the Yellow God?
-Innogen: I can't say I've heard of such a thing.
-Innogen: But in any case, we don't specialise in god studies here.
-Innogen: Our collection is mostly historical and religious texts.
-Innogen: Books on the Old Way. Documents on the legacy of the Shrew Empire. That sort of thing.
-Verm: That's no good to me.
-Innogen: Mm-hmm.

/Lib
-Verm: I've heard many great things about Cranbaile's library. It's actually why I came here.
-Innogen: Mm-hmm. We do take pride in our literacy here.
-Innogen: But you came at a bad time. The library is but a shadow of what it once was.
-Innogen: First, our best scholars migrated to Murida for better opportunities.
-Innogen: Then that accursed felidae arrived and gobbled up half the village.
-Innogen: All I can do now is manage the knowledge that remains.
-Verm: That's a shame.
-Innogen: Mm-hmm.

/Nevermind
-Verm: Never mind.
-Innogen: Mm-hmm.

/Letter

-InfoBig: Dear Ruth,||I hope all's well at the Nook. I wanted to pay a visit for the young King's coronation, but alas, Cranbaile needs its librarian...

/LetterLate
-InfoBig: Dear Ruth,||The felidae hasn't given us cause for concern in a while, thank the heavens.||The bustle and tension of Murida sounds miserable! Maybe you should pack up shop for a while and come visit Cranbaile. I have a big bed...
-Innogen: Oi! Nosey.
-Verm: Sorry.
-Innogen: Mm-hmm.

/ReadIt1
-Book1: As personal bodyguards to lords, ladies, kings, and queens, blademasters are required to be loyal, chivalrous, and of course, exceptional in combat.
-Book2: In contrast, a loremaster serves their liege by offering wisdom gained from two whole seasons of study at a licensed university.
-Book1: Larger cities often employ a variety of other masters to serve as advisers.||Plaguemasters oversee the health of a colony. Seedmasters manage the city's treasury. Buildmasters specialise in urban planning.

*ReadIt2: Read it.
*PutBack: Put it back.

/ReadIt2
-Book1: To follow the path of the Old Way, thou must abide by three laws.||Thou shalt not harm a god.|Thou shalt avoid the gods' gaze.|Thou shalt not toy with a god's tools.

-Book2: The raven squinted at the fanged wyrm before him. "You're not going to bite me, are you?"||"I wouldn't dream of ssssuch a thing," the viper replied. Her forked tongue flicked back and forth.
-Book1: Against his better judgment, the raven agreed. He picked up the viper in his talons, spread his wings, and flew skyward.||Soon enough, the two landed on the other side of the river, safe and unharmed. The viper bowed in thanks.
-Book2: "Hold up," said the raven. "Why didn't you bite me? You had every opportunity. Isn't biting in your nature?"||The viper smiled. "In all thingsss of nature there is something of the marvellousssss."
