/Tadhg
-Tadhg: I come here just to smell the books.|Mmm, love that new book scent.

/Book1
-InfoBig: You see a book titled, "The Moonlight Mystery". It looks dark.
*ReadIt1: Read it.
*PutBack: Put it back.

/ReadIt1
-Book1: The detective gazed at the scene. Blood splatters. Claw marks. Furniture torn in two. All the classic hallmarks of a titan attack, just like the old mole had said.
-Book2: But something didn't add up. Why did the victim reach for his silver knife instead of his steel sword? Unless...||A shiver shot down the detective's spine, and a whisper passed through her teeth. "Muswolf."

/Book2
-InfoBig: You see a book titled, "The Destitute". It's heavy.
*ReadIt2: Read it.
*PutBack: Put it back.

/ReadIt2
-Book1: Sir Jacques threw a ragged vole at the Loremaster's feet. "I caught this scum making off into the night with a bag of your seeds."||The Loremaster shook his head. "Why, this rodent is no thief. I gave him those seeds as a parting gift."
-Book2: Sir Jacques let out a huff. He turned to his prisoner. "It seems that the Loremaster has saved your tail today. But mark my words, I've got my eye on you, Volejean."

/Book3
-InfoBig: You see a book titled, "Star-crossed Squirrels". It looks well-read.
*ReadIt3: Read it.
*PutBack: Put it back.

/ReadIt3
-Book1:   Mariette:|"Oh dearest Sheena,|I long to once again feel thy embrace,|And yet I fret our love cannot be so,|For squirrels Grey and Red cannot be wed,|Lest our fathers clash in battle throe."
-Book2:   Sheena:|"Clans Grey and Red are naught but shades,|Mere dye upon an artist's canvas.|If colour stands before our love,|Then I renounce my father's hue!|Come take my paw, dear Mariette,|And let us paint a colour new."

/Book4
-InfoBig: You see a book titled, "Nora's Fall" by Loremaster Tobin.
*ReadIt4: Read it.
*PutBack: Put it back.

/ReadIt4
-Book1: Shrew Empress Nora was born in the twilight years of the Golden Laurel Empire, an era marked by rampant inflation, unprecedented austerity, and endless plagues.
-Book2: The citizens of Muridium called for respite from their squalor, but Nora had none to offer.||"If the mice are hungry, they can eat their thatched roofs," the Empress famously muttered.
-Book1: On a late Summer's day, tensions came to a boil. Citizens pounded on the palace doors and demanded justice.||The senators, led by Senator Decimus, were happy to oblige.
-Book2: Speaking to the crowd, Decimus denounced Nora as the sole source of the citizens' ills. He proposed that, to assess Nora's guilt, she be put through a Trial by Fire, an arcane test even for its time.
-Book1: The imperial guards constructed a great pyre of timbre and straw in Muridium's city square. They tied Nora to its central mast.||With a single spark, the pyre ignited, and the crowd let loose a raucous cheer.
-Book2: The fire ate its fair share, but it hungered for more.||Flames danced from pyre to haystack, from haystack to roof, and soon, the whole city was ablaze.
-Book1: The damage caused by the Great Fire Trial was immense.||Muridium burned to the ground, thousands of rodents died, and millions were displaced. The godly city above too suffered greatly.
-Book2: Thus, the great Golden Laurel Empire was reduced to ash.


/Book5
-InfoBig: You see a book titled, "James's Ascent" Loremaster Tobin.
*ReadIt5: Read it.
*PutBack: Put it back.

/ReadIt5
-Book1: When the flames of the Great Fire Trial grew beyond control, the imperial soldiers were the first to scatter and flee, leaving the Muridium citizens to a blazing demise.||But then, a mouse peasant called Artura stepped forward.
-Book2: She rounded up a dozen of her peers - James, Vishruvius, and Grace the Red among them - and demonstrated how to fashion a smoke-proof mask from a thimble and a dampened cloth. The group set to work putting out fires and directing others to safety.
-Book1: The fire consumed Muridium and much of Rodentia.||However, thanks to Artura's quick and selfless actions, thousands of lives were saved from a horrific demise.
-Book2: In the following days, once the ash had settled and the tears had been shed, the people of Muridium nominated Artura to lead the city as the first in a new line of monarchs. But she declined the offer, nominating James the black rat in her stead.
-Book1: Thus, James was crowned as the first King of Rodentia, with Artura serving as both Blademaster and founder of the|aptly-named|"Thimble Guard".||Out of the ashes of Muridium, the modern city of Murida was constructed.
-Book2: Since James's crowning, the Blue Rat monarchy has reigned over Rodentia for over 300 years.||Why exactly Artura declined the throne will perhaps forever be a mystery.

/Book6

/Book7
-InfoBig: You see a book titled, "Gods: Life and Death" by Loremaster Sandra
*ReadIt7: Read it.
*PutBack: Put it back.

/ReadIt7
-Book1: As a Loremaster who has dedicated her life to studying the behaviour of gods, the most common question I get asked is, "are the gods mortal?"
-Book2: A controversial subject, to be sure, but there are verified witness accounts of gods succumbing to death by sickness, grievous carriage injury, and even old age.
-Book1: The second most common question I get is, "how do the gods reproduce?", to which I answer, "noisily".
-Book2:  

/Book8
