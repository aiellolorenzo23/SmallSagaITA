-Aquila: A rodent's life is short and pathetic.
-Aquila: So intergenerational knowledge is crucial if we wish to push the boundary of understanding.
-Aquila: It took decades to find and decipher the relevant god texts, to reverse engineer the wiring and machinery.
-Aquila: Through careful analysis, my predecessors learned every intricacy of the weapon.

-Aquila: I was born beneath the floorboards of a godly library, so I learned how to read godly writing from a young age.
-Aquila: The first book I ever read was a heavy tome entitled "The Anthropocene".
-Aquila: At first, I thought I was reading a speculative text.
-Aquila: A science fiction parable, a warning about what could become.
-Aquila: But the more I read, the more I came to realise that it documented the horrors of what the gods did and what they continue to do.

-Aquila: If they cannot, they kill it.
-Aquila: There is not a single place on our planet that the gods haven't colonised and corrupted.
-Aquila: So now carcinogens fill our lungs. Poisons infest our food. Plastics course through our blood.
-Aquila: By their hand, soon the oceans themselves will boil.
-Aquila: The Yellow God is not the worst god. No, not by a long shot.
-Aquila: But He epitomises their callous disregard for life, their need to dominate nature without second thought.
-Aquila: What is the death of one million mice to the Yellow God? An ordinary day of work. A job well done.
