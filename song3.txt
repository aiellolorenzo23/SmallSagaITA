002 Friends, Rodents, Countrymice
004 Prick up your ears
007 And attend to this ditty of mine
012 And if it should please you
015 To buy me a beer
017 Then I'll sing you a song sweet as wine
023 I've roamed this world over
026 A rat-tailed rover
029 A scholar of poem and song
034 So buy me an ale
036 And I'll spin you a tale
039 For tomorrow I'm roving along
045 I've crossed the great waters
047 I've wooed sons and daughters
050 Of Rat-kings and Vole-counts galore
055 But leave 'em I must
058 For I'm slave to my wanderlust
061 Shipping my songs shore to shore
066 I've roamed this world over
069 A rat-tailed rover
072 A scholar of poem and song
076 So buy me an ale
079 And I'll spin you a tale
082 For tomorrow I'm roving along
087 And I'll share for a florin
090 The Horned Rats of Corinth's Dance,
093 learned from an aged Rhatsode
099 As they danced bacchanals
101 By the Isthmus canal
104 To the strain of the Dorian mode
109 I've roamed this world over
112 A rat-tailed rover
114 A scholar of poem and song
120 So buy me an ale
122 And I'll spin you a tale
125 For tomorrow I'm roving along.
