-Verm: I guess from the outside my quest looked a bit stupid.
-Verm: But I never had any delusions about what I was doing.
-Verm: I knew I was never going to get my brother or my tail back from the Yellow God.
-Verm: So I chased the Yellow God's shadow.
-Verm: The hunt brought me... well, not quite peace. But something. An outlet. A direction for my anger.

-Verm: What do you mean?
-Siobhan: Well, there's a lot of gossip in the city about why you didn't kill the Yellow God.
-Siobhan: Some think you let Him go|as an act of mercy.
-Siobhan: Others think it was so he could relay a message to the other gods.|"Stay away from Murida!"
-Siobhan: But to me, those reasons|didn't add up.
-Siobhan: So is it that you held back because you knew he wasn't the right god? You knew that it wouldn't be real justice?
-Verm: No, that's not it at all.
-Verm: As far as I care, this Yellow God is as guilty as the last.
-Verm: I let Him go because, well...

-Siobhan: The King never had any children.
-Siobhan: There are others in his bloodline, cousins and the like, but nobody's come forward to assert their claim.
-Verm: Probably scared off after hearing about the old king's death.
-Verm: Not to mention the whole|God of Death apocalypse thing.
-Siobhan: Most likely.
